title: About
---

I am:

- currently, a~~n evil quant~~ researcher at a prop trading firm in New York
- generally, a vaguely mathy-tech-y person who is interested in understanding how things work.

I have:

- grown up in Foster City, California
- graduated from MIT with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
- done an M.Eng thesis and several semesters of research with the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/)
- lived in [Random Hall](http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/)
- done an internship at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), on the [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) engineering team (rest in peace, Mailbox!)
- been involved in the [MIT Educational Students Program](https://esp.mit.edu/teach/), particularly organizing [Junction](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Junction/) and developing the [website](https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website)

I like:

- learning things!
- teaching {computers,people} how to do things
- probabilistic modeling and inference; and more generally, ways of understanding the world through the lens of math and/or data
- functional programming[^languages]
- reconfiguring my computer, in a self-inflicting sort of way[^computer]
- puzzles
- games[^games]
- playing the flute
- Sichuan food

[^languages]: My currently job involves programming in OCaml, which is probably my now favorite programming language that I've written anything substantial in. However, Python is still my go-to for quick scripts and oddends.
[^computer]: My computer runs [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), which I've reinstalled at least four times. Emacs is my text editor of choice, and my keyboard layout is [Colemak](http://colemak.com/).
[^games]: I'm not super into video games now, but I did play them in my childhood through high school. I've often been more interested in investigating the mechanics of games and their implications than actually playing the game though. I also enjoy board/card games, as long as they're not too long/complex.

title: About
---

I am:

- an M.Eng student in EECS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
- doing a thesis on compilers for probabilistic programs supervised by [Vikash Mansinghka](http://web.mit.edu/vkm/www/)

I have:

- grown up in Foster City, California
- lived in [Random Hall](http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/) during undergrad
- interned at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), on the [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) engineering team
- been involved in the [MIT Educational Students Program](https://esp.mit.edu/teach/), particularly organizing [Junction](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Junction/) and developing the [website](https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website)
- been a part of the [MIT Concert Choir](http://web.mit.edu/21m401/www/) and the [MIT Concert Band](http://band.mit.edu/)

I like:

- learning things!
- teaching computers how to do things
- teaching people how to do things
- math, particularly probabilistic modeling and inference
- functional programming[^languages]
- reconfiguring my computer, in a self-inflicting sort of way[^computer]
- playing the flute
- board and card games
- Sichuan food

[^languages]: I'm always equivocating between Haskell, Clojure, and Scala as my favorite programming language, although Python is still my go-to for quick scripts and oddends.
[^computer]: My computer runs [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), which I've reinstalled at least four times. Emacs is my text editor of choice, and my keyboard layout is [Colemak](http://colemak.com/).

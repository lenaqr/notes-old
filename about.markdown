I am:

- a~~n evil quant~~ researcher at Jane Street Capital

I have:

- grown up in Foster City, California
- graduated from MIT with an M.Eng in EECS
- done research on probabilistic programming with the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/)
- lived in [Random Hall](http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/)
- been an intern at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), on the [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) engineering team
- been involved in the [MIT Educational Students Program](https://esp.mit.edu/teach/), particularly organizing [Junction](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Junction/) and developing the [website](https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website)
- been a part of the [MIT Concert Choir](http://web.mit.edu/21m401/www/) and the [MIT Concert Band](http://band.mit.edu/)

I like:

- learning things!
- teaching {computers,people} how to do things
- math, particularly probabilistic modeling and inference
- functional programming[^languages]
- reconfiguring my computer, in a self-inflicting sort of way[^computer]
- playing the flute
- board and card games
- Sichuan food

[^languages]: I equivocate between Haskell, Clojure, and Scala as my favorite programming language, although Python is still my go-to for quick scripts and oddends. *Update (2017): I now have a job that involves programming in OCaml, and I am a fan of it, although it does have its quirks.*
[^computer]: My computer runs [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), which I've reinstalled at least four times. Emacs is my text editor of choice, and my keyboard layout is [Colemak](http://colemak.com/).

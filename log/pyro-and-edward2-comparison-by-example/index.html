    <p>To get a flavor of the probabilistic programming frameworks Pyro and Edward2, I
decided to implement some examples in each of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started with a small example cribbed from the Pyro docs. Notebooks:
<a href="https://github.com/luanthe/notebooks/blob/master/2018-12-16%20pyro.ipynb">Pyro</a> <a href="https://github.com/luanthe/notebooks/blob/master/2018-12-16%20edward.ipynb">Edward2</a></p>
<p>My first&nbsp;impressions:</p>
<p>Pyro has a much more organized set of tutorials and examples that explain each
of its features. Edward2 &#8212; and Tensorflow Probability in general of which it is
a part &#8212; lacks anything comparable. There is a set of lengthier standalone
examples showcasing various things you can do, but it&#8217;s hard to get a complete
picture from them. Hopefully this will get better with&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Also, while Pyro does <span class="caps">SVI</span> out of the box, Edward2 doesn&#8217;t seem to have a built
in variational inference op at all; you have to spell out the <span class="caps">ELBO</span> objective.
This would make sense if Edward2 is in some sense complementary to existing
frameworks, especially Edward 1. You could do vanilla <span class="caps">VI</span> in Edward, so Edward2
is for everything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>Next I&#8217;d like to take one of the standalone examples in Edward2 and rewrite it
in&nbsp;Pyro.</p>
<p>Update: I obviously never got back to this, but <a href="https://colcarroll.github.io/ppl-api/">someone else did something
similar</a> with many frameworks. It&#8217;s more aimed toward the common use
patterns of each <span class="caps">API</span>, whereas I would&#8217;ve liked to do examples digging into some
lower level details, but that&#8217;s a task for another&nbsp;day.</p>

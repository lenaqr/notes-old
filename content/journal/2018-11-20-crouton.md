title: Emacs on a Chromebook
----

This week I'm away from home and my main computer is a Chromebook.

I think Chromebooks are great and cover most of what I'd want from a computer on
the go, but sometimes Chrome OS is not enough: for instance, this week I wanted
a Linux environment with emacs/python/git so I could update [this
website][luanthe].

I've heard of [crouton][crouton] as a way to install Linux on a Chromebook. In
my case, I didn't want to replace Chrome OS entirely. Instead, I set it up so
that I have Emacs running in a window within Chrome OS. crouton can do this too!

The setup was pretty easy to figure out from the examples in the crouton readme,
but here's exactly what I did:

0. Enable developer mode
1. Download `crouton`
2. Open a shell (Ctrl+Alt+T, `shell`)
3. Run `sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xiwi`
4. `sudo enter-chroot`
5. `sudo apt-get install emacs git`
6. (Optional) Set up your Emacs configuration. I use [Spacemacs][spacemacs], so
   I installed it with `git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs
   ~/.emacs.d`
7. `exit`
8. Start emacs from the shell by running `sudo startxiwi emacs`

At work I've been moving toward [using Emacs everywhere][eshell], so having
Emacs be my main interface to the Linux side works pretty well for me.

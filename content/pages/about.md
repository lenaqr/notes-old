I'm currently a<del>n evil quant</del> researcher at a trading firm in New York. I like thinking about algorithms, abstractions, and how to do the right thing.

Some more tidbits about me:

- I grew up in California
- I lived in [Random Hall](http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/) at MIT
- My degree is in computer science, and I did an M.Eng. thesis on probabilistic programming
- At work I program in OCaml, and it's been a surprisingly great programming experience (might write a post about this at some point)
- I use the keyboard layout [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) and I can type 120 wpm
- I play the piano and the flute (though not regularly anymore)
- My favorite food is Sichuan food
- My most distinctive physical feature is probably my hair
- I've rebuilt this website three times and I still haven't put anything useful on it! Maybe this will change.

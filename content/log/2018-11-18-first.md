What this log is and isn't:

It's mostly for me, rather than for any particular audience. In fact, I expect zero people to follow it.

It might be useful as a record of the kinds of stuff I think about.

I want to stay away from long-form writing or any standard of quality or polish. I can never keep that up. Entries should be written in one sitting, no drafts.

I guess it's like a linkblog/microblog. But not focused on current events or my personal life.

Title: A Bayesian approach is not the prior

Andrew Gordon Wilson, [The Case for Bayesian Deep Learning][case]:

> The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization instead of optimization, not the prior, or Bayes rule [...]

[case]: https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/caseforbdl/

This is a great point which [I agree with][not-priors], and understanding this gave me greater respect for explicitly-Bayesian approaches, compared with those based on function optimization. Optimization can be very brittle, and Bayesian model averaging departs from it significantly in a way that is both theoretically appealing and may have practical promise.
